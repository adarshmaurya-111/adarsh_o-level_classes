		<h1 style="color:blue;font-size:30px;text-align:center;">TOPLOGY</h1>
		<p>the physical and logical arrangements of elements in a network is called as topology. topology defines the physical structure and media of a network.<br>
			<ol>
				<li><h2 style="color:red;">BUS TOPOLOGY</h2></li>
				<p>In this network a single backbone cable is used to connect different systems.BNC-T (british Navak cibbector) connectors are used for connrctivity. termunators are placed at both the ends of cables. Termunators are used to stop unwanted signals in the network.</p>
			<h3 style="color:yellow;">**ADVANTAGE**</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>esay to configure and manage </li>
				<li>single cable required </li>
				<li>cost effective </li>
				<li>esay to expand</li>
				<li>good for smaller network</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 style="color:yellow;">**DISADVANTAGE**</h3>
			<oL>
				<li>if there is a break in the main cable, whole network is affected </li>
				<li>termunators are required at both ends of the backbone cable</li>
				<li>if the no. of syste increase, the perfotmance will get down </li>
				<li>not meant to be used as a stand-alone solution </li>
				<li>collision problem</li>
			</ol>
				<li><h2 style="color:red;">STAR TOPOLOGY</h2></li>
				<p>All the system of the network is connected to a centralized device called as network switch. Centralized device is responsible for data transmission.all the system are directly connented to centralized to centralized device through cables.<br>
				<h3 style="color:yellow;">**ADVANTAGE**</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>centralized management</li>
				<li>esay to install and manage </li>
				<li>new device can easily be connected </li>
			</ol>
				<h3 style="color:yellow;">**DISADVANTAGE**</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>dependency of centralized device</li>
				<li>more cables are required</li>
				<li>costly than BUS topology</li>
			</ol>
				<li><h2 style="color:red;">RING TOPOLOGY</h2></li>
				in a ring TOPOLOGY, all computers are connected via a cable that loops on a ring toopology is a circle that has no start and no end and terminators ate not necessary in a ring topology. signals travel in one direction on a eing while they pass from one computer to the next with each computer regeenerating the signal so that it may travel the distance required.
				<h3 style="color:yellow;">**ADVANTAGE**</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>collision free network</li>
			</ol>
				<h3 style="color:yellow;">**DISADVANTAGE**</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>if one system stops woeking in the ring then whole network got affected </li>
			</ol>
				<li><h2 style="color:red;">MESH TOPOLOGY</h2>
				in mesh topology, every network device is connected to other network device. mesh topology is costly because os the extra cables neede and it is very complex and difficolt to manage . the main advantage of mesh tooology is multiple paths to the destination computer . if one link is down, we have anoter path to reach toe destinatiion. mesh topology is not commonly used these days.</li>
				<li><h2 style="color:red;"> HYBRID TOPOLOGY</h2>
				When two or more then two topolgies are combined to form a network, then it is called as hubrid topology.</li>

		<h1 style="color:blue;font-size:30px;text-align:center;">Protocol</h1>
		<p>peotocols are predefined rules and regulations which are used for communication in network. there are numbers of protocols defined for communication in network.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><h3  style="color:red;">internet protocol (IP)</h3>
				it is an universal and standard protocol. it is used for communication in diffrernt networks in different systems. in this, the system is allicated with a ligical address on the base of which any system is identified in the network. ip address is of teo types:
					<ol type="a">
							<li><h4 style="color:yellow;">IPv4</h4>
								IPv4 is a logical address of 32 bit system. it is used to identify system in networks . ip address consist of 2 parts:network bit and gost bit, netwrok bit is used to identify the network whereas host bit is used to identify a particolar device in a netwrk.<br>
								ip address consist of 4 octets which are seprated with the help of dots. each octet has 8 binary bits which have decimal values from 0 to 255.<br>
							<span>To cinfigure ip address, there are two types of ip addressing used:</span>
								<ol type="i">
									<li>class ful ip addressing :- in this. ip addressing are divided in 5 different classes. each class are identified by range.range are always cheched on first octet of ip address. by default the network bit, host bit and the subnet mask is fixed.</li>
									<li>class less ip addressing:- the network bit, host bit and subnet mask is fixed on the basis of class in class full ip addrssing, whereas in class less ip addrssing for any i[ addrss the subnet mask, network bit and host bit is decided bu the network administrator. sibnetting is used for this. by subnetting a lage network can be sub divided into small-small network.</li>
								</ol>
							<li><h4 style="color:yellow;">IPv6</h4>
								it is the latest version of ip address. it is a 128-bit address in which 64 bits are used for network bit and the rest 64 bites ate used as host bit . it is represented in 32 hexadecimal digits.</li>
					</ol>
				<li><h3  style="color:red;">Transmission control Protocol(TCP)</h3>
				this protocol is responsible for end to end data transmission. it is also known as connection oriented protocol because in this protocol a connection is established before data transmission and it is mainted till the end of data transmission. TCP is a reliable protocol because after the data Transmission,it sends an acknowledgment to the source tcp bracks the data into segments before data transmission. all the data segments are assigned a sequence number. on the basis of these sequence number the data segmnts are rearranged and converted into data. each data segments have data and geaders segments size is of 20 to 65536 bytes. data heades consist of different control information/ tcp is a heavy weight protocol and so the data teansmission speed is slow bit reliable.</li>
				<li><h3  style="color:red;">file transfer protocol(FTP)</h3>
				ftp is an application layer service . it is used for exchangeing of foles in internet. it is a tcp based application service. its logical TCP/IP no. is 21.<br>
				FTP has 2 element: ftp server and ftp client. when a file is transfer from client to server, it is called as uploading and when a file is transfer from server to client it is called as downloading. tcp sessio is establish for communication between ftp server and client it has 2 connection:
					<ol>
						<li>data connection</li>
						<li>control connection </li>
					</ol>
				in control connection, control information like ftp commands are transfer between ftp server and client whereas data connection is responsible for file transmission.control connrction is established till the end of ftp session ehereas data connection open/close according to the no. of files. for communication between client and server,  ftp command are executed.</li>
				<li><h3  style="color:red;">Tele network (TELNET)</h3>
				telnet is used for login in remote system. its logical TCP/IP port no is 23.<br>
				by using ftp and http protocols only file transmission can be done but in a network if you want to login as a regular user then telnet is used. by using telnet user can remote ligin on remote system and can access files and application program.<br>
				communication is insercure in telnet because communication is done in plain text form. that's why at resent telnet is replaced by SSh.</li>
				<li><h3  style="color:red;">>Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP)</h3>
				it is an email protocol, it is responsible for transferring mail for mail server. it uses TCP/IP services for mail transfer. its ligical port no is 25. <br>
				<span>WORKING:-</span> A two way transmission service is established between SMTP servers of both sender and receiver for mail transmission in which STMP commands are sent or recrive. normally, SMTP server of sender and recriver are connecte on same transport service bit if they use diffrernt transport service, then erlay STMP service is used, it woeks as an forwarder which 
				forwards mail form mail server to another.</li>
